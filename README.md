# Technologies used
I am proficient with HTML/CSS - currently I code my sites using bootstrap or w3schools. You can also find some simple JS games.
I'm planning on shifting from clean HTML/CSS to Django, so soon the site will have a drastic makeover - not only front, but also backend.

# Not only coding
I am planing to writa a blog from the perspective of a teacher / coder / father ;) Also I'm doing some translation and editing freelance work if you would like to check it.
